# Pokemon
Human player only has hyper potion,  Computer player has ether and hyper potion(Randomly chooses),  If Pokemon runs out of power points it rests and recovers for one turn and gains back half its max power points,  run method exits the system,  If power points is out for one move you can still use other moves,  If the wrong integer is inputed, you are asked to input again,  If Pokemon's health is maxed and you try to use a hyper potion, you are going to be ask to put a different input,  All the effectiveness is calculated in the Attack class (Made sure there was cases for super effective, not effect, and not very effective),  Giving hyper potion or ether to Pokemon wont make it exceed its Max health or its Max power points,  If Computer player's Pokemon has max health and max power points, its going to randomly choose between attacking or running away,  Code displays each Pokemon's stats after attacking or using Item,  Effectiveness is calculated based on the Gen 1 chart provided on the worksheet
